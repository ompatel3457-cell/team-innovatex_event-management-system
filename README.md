Event Management System (EMS)

This repository contains all documentation deliverables for the Event Management System final project completed by Team Innovate X Solutions.
This is a documentation-only project — no application or code development was required. Instead, the focus is on project planning, system design, documentation, requirements, and project management artifacts.

All files related to requirements, user stories, ERD, test plan, screenshots, project charter, and Basecamp planning are stored in this repo for instructor review.

🧾 1. Project Overview

The Event Management System (EMS) is a documentation-based academic project designed to demonstrate full software planning, analysis, and design. Our objective was to produce all the necessary documents that would normally be required before starting actual development.

The system is conceptualized to help event organizers, attendees, and sponsors manage events, register, upload ads, and view analytics. Although no physical application was developed, the system is fully designed through documentation, diagrams, and structured planning.

🎯 2. Project Objectives

Develop a complete Project Charter with scope, risks, schedule, milestones, and deliverables.

Create detailed functional & non-functional requirements.

Write user stories with acceptance criteria for multiple user personas.

Design a system ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) outlining full data structures.

Develop a Test Plan that covers all system validation and testing scenarios.

Use Basecamp to manage tasks, sprints, planning, and documentation.

Create a structured, public GitHub repository to store and organize all deliverables.

Provide LLM Acknowledgement showing ethical AI usage.

Deliver final presentation material summarizing the project.
